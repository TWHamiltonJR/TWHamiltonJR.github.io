## Project description

This assembly file asks the user to input two numbers and it will add them together.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
./output.o [number1] [number2]
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
