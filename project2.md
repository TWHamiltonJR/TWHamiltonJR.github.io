## Project description

This python script sends an email to the designated address through the email provided.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python newsmtp.py
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
